# Workloads

In Kubernetes, you run your application as a _workload_. There are various ways
to orchestrate workloads, for instance using the _deployment_ resource, the
_statefulSet_ or the _daemonSet_ resource.

Many apps consist of various different workloads, which need to work together in
order to serve the application as a whole.
