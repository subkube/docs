Open the Projects page and click the Create Project button Tip For hardcore command line users, we've created subctl , a simple CLI tool allowing you to log in to SubKube and interact with your Projects and Namespace directly from your shell, just as you would with kubectl . More about subctl here Create a Namespace After creating a project, we need to create a Kubernetes Namespace to deploy our Workloads to. This can easily be done from a Project page, by clicking the Create Namespace button. Setup Kubectl In order to use kubectl , we need to setup our kubeconfig . On your projects' page you will find the Kubeconfig card, which allows you to download the kubeconfig as a file, which will be called subkubeconfig , or you can show the kubeconfig for inspection or manual copy-pasting / distribution. Tip If you have subctl installed, you can simply run the following to automatically setup your existing kubeconfig to allow access to subkube: subctl use project <project-uuid> Deploy workloads Once we have our project, namespace and kubectl configured, we can check to see if everything works by running a test pod interactively: kubectl run -n <YOUR-NAMESPACE> -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#signing-up","text":"To start using SubKube, sign up for an account","title":"Signing up"},{"location":"getting_started/#create-a-project","text":"Once you've signed up and are logged in to SubKube, you need to create a project to deploy Namespaces and Workloads to.
